                                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Introduction</h2>
                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5"> Before beginning my final project, this past week, I worked on a sprint project with my peer, 
                                    Eric Lee, where we learned how to 3D print the correct parts to assemble a prosthetic hand. More specifically, Eric and I assembled 
                                    the Phoenix Hand V2, where we observed our learning preferences, choosing between written or verbal instructions, as well as what we 
                                    can add to our hand to provide a new function. Although there were quite a lot of challenges (that I will get into later on in this 
                                    write up), learning from our mistakes, collaboration, and clear communication is what made us execute a working prosthetic hand!
                                </p>

                                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Parts 1 and 2: Reviewing Documentation & 3D Printing</h2>
                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">The first step to this project was to review documentation for the open source hardware that
                                     is needed in order to assemble and establish the hand itself. Thus, the first resource that I explored was e-NABLE, where I reviewed 
                                     sources in regard to the Phoenix Hand V2. After reading and comprehending the descriptions of each part of the hand, I decided to download 
                                     each part as an .STL file, which I then downloaded onto PrusaSlicer. After successfully downloading each file, I had to scale each part 
                                     to 150% and position each part onto 3 printing plates. At this stage, I decided to print the palm and the gauntlet with organic supports, 
                                     and Eric would 3D print all of the other parts in order to be efficient with our printing process. Finally, we decided that we wanted to 
                                     print a left hand because I am a lefty!
                                    </p>
                                    <br><br/>
                                    <img class="card-img-top" src="project_4/part_1_info.png" alt="..." />
                                    <br><br/>
                                    <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">In regard to what we used in order to assemble our prosthetic hand, we first used the introduction 
                                        slides from e-NABLE and two different YoutTube tutorials: How to Assemble a Phoenix v2 Hand and Phoenix V2 Hand assembly. After going through 
                                        each slide and tutorial when assembling our prosthetic hand, I can confidently say that I prefer watching the YouTube tutorials in comparison 
                                        to the introduction slides from e-NABLE. I believe that the introduction slides lacked a lot of information and clarity, meaning, when we first 
                                        started assembling our hand, we were going through a lot of trial and error to see where each part went. For example, when attaching the fingers 
                                        to the joints, the only way they differentiated the index figure to the others was the word “short”. I feel like providing a measurement of the 
                                        finger itself would have been a lot easier to identify, as the length of all the fingers were extremely close in size.  
                                    </p>
                                        <img class="card-img-top" src="project_4/instruction_info.png" alt="..." />
                                        <br><br/>
                                </p>
                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">This was the primary reason as to why I really preferred watching the tutorials rather than reading the instructions, 
                                    as they were able to articulate each part from the next in ways that I could understand. Since I am more of a visual learner, when it came to the process of 
                                    stringing the fingers together in order to create movement, it was a lot easier watching a tutorial rather than reading the written instructions. In addition, 
                                    I believe that by me and Eric watching the tutorials together, we were extremely precise and efficient when assembling!
                                    <br><br/>
                                </p>
                                   <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">Finally, I feel like there is a lot of opportunity for this assembly process to be more efficient for my future peers.
                                     For example, I believe that if there was a specific tutorial or instruction manual that got more into the specifics of the 3D printing process (i.e. using snug 
                                     or organic supports), it would make the assembly process quicker. In my experience with this project, Eric decided to use snug supports for his parts, and I decided
                                      to print my parts with organic. When taking my supports off, everything popped off very easily, whereas with Eric, it took a while to get everything off without 
                                      damaging any of the parts he printed. In addition to this subtle challenge, another one we faced was the elastic string we used in order to string the fingers together 
                                      in order to create movement. When we first used the elastic string, none of the fingers would bend. At first we thought it was because we tied the knots of the string 
                                      too tight, but then we realized it was simply the wrong material. After correcting this mistake (by taking out the elastic string and replacing it with a “window-blind 
                                      string” as Professor Roy categorizes it), the fingers finally started to bend. With that being said, it would definitely be beneficial to clearly articulate which type 
                                      of string is needed in order for the fingers to move without difficulty. 
                                </p>

                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">Finally, the last suggestion I am making is that there should be a slide or a tutorial that talks about the tools and wait-time that 
                                    needs to be implemented in order to mold the gauntlet from completely flat to curved. This suggestion is out of curiosity, as I am genuinely curious about knowing the tool 
                                    names and wait-times that TA Gianna used in order to mold the gauntlet successfully. 
                                </p>

                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">With using, implementing, and comprehending all the resources that were made available, Eric and I successfully assembled our prosthetic hand!

                                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Part 3: Extend, Critique, & Reflect</h2>
                                    <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">The final part of project 4 was to create an add on to our prosthetic hand and give it a new use besides it being a functioning hand.
                                         That is when Eric and I decided to go to the drawing board and brainstorm our add on. This is when we decided to create a paintbrush that would sit alongside the index figure, 
                                         which would then allow someone to paint. At first, we were thinking of creating an attachment that included the paintbrush. We decided to first sketch out our idea and then create
                                          our vision in the well-known computer-aided design (CAD) software, Fusion360. 
                                          </p>
                                        <img class="card-img-top" src="project_4/sketch_fusion.png" alt="..." />
                                        <br><br/>
                                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">However, after carefully considering the size and bulkiness of the handle (of the paintbrush), as well as not having the ability to 
                                            change the type of brush, we decided to just create an attachment feature. Therefore, with the help of another YouTube tutorial entitled, “Project Sketch on Curved Surface - 
                                            Fusion 360”, we then illustrated and executed our second prototype of this additional feature into Fusion360.
                                            <br><br/>

                                            <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">I believe that if Eric and I followed through with the printing process, I think that our attachment would have been successful. 
                                            </p>                                
                                    <h2 class="fw-bolder">Part 4: Reflections</h2> 
                                    <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">After collaborating with Eric on project 4, there is a lot to reflect on. First, I can definitely say that I love working in pairs when 
                                        tackling a tedious project like this. Seeing his approach and strategies when assembling the hand together, interpreting the instructions, as well as seeing how he documented 
                                        this process made me want to refine some of my strategies. I thought this project was fairly straightforward and I can definitely see myself using the tools and skills I learned 
                                        from this project to the final project that we will present at the end of April of this year. In addition, the rapid prototyping aspect of this project was my favorite part, as 
                                        it really reminded me of the current Business Graduate Level course that I am in currently, Entrepreneurship and Rapid Prototyping. As a person who wants to pursue a career in 
                                        business, I am always trying to see how different careers resonate with business, therefore, I was very happy to see this intersection of business and engineering! 
                                            <br>
                                            <br><br/>
                                        Lastly, one thing that I really enjoyed connecting project 4 with was the reading entitled, “What Can a Body Do?” by Sara Hendron. Throughout this reading, she mentions that there 
                                        is a clear connection between a piece of technology and its user. For example, when using the e-NABLE organization for this project, I noticed the amount of ways technology can benefit 
                                        human life, where we can create one thing (i.e. prosthetic hand) and add on to it (i.e. paintbrush attachment) to create more opportunities. Having the mental mindset of innovation,
                                        for any career path, is crucial to one’s motivation for personal growth and determination to make a difference if that is what they decide to endure. As a person that is always looking 
                                        for innovative ways to benefit society, the connection between this reading and project 4 really made me more emotionally and mentally present to produce a useful product.
