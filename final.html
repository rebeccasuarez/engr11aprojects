                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5"> Before really starting our final project for this class, the first thing my group and I were assigned was 
                                    to interview 4 different people that would help us determine if our product would be make a positive change to a specific group of people. After each 
                                    of my group member, Aidan and Ava, as well as myself, conducted 20 minute interviews, we were able to complete and establish these charts:
                                </p>

                                <br></br>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Problem Definition</h2>
                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">Learning how to play the guitar may be a time-consuming, frustrating, and overall,
                                    a negative experience to the average consumer. Additionally, learning how to play guitar with a hand disability may
                                    result in zero attempt of learning or giving up due to the physical and mental demands. So, what if there was a product 
                                    that could help both beginner guitar players and those with a disability? Now introducing, Guitar Buddy!
                                </p>

                                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Thematic Analysis</h2>
                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">After interviewing each significant person, my group and I moved onto the next step:
                                    creating a thematic analysis. Here, my group and I decided to right down themes we witnessed in each of our interviews. From this,
                                we determined that there are four distinct groups: initial struggles, longterm fatigue and discomfort, product recommendation, and 
                            arthritis specific.  </p>
                                <img class="card-img-top" src="final_project/thematic_map.png" alt="..." />
                                <br></br>
                                <h4 class="fw-bolder">Determining our Insight and "How Might We?" statements: </h4>
                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">After creating themes in our thematic analysis, it was now time for my group and I to
                                    create our insight and "How Might We?" statements to further help us understand the problem that we are trying to overcome. Thus, after a 
                                    brief overview of our thematic chart, we establish these statements: 
                                </p>
                                <img class="card-img-top" src="final_project/statements.png" alt="..." />
                                <br></br>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Brainstorming</h2>
                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">After creating a thematic analysis chart, as well as creating our insight and "How Might We?" statements,
                                     to help organize our thoughts, the next step was to start brainstorming what our final product would look like. My group and I then decided 
                                     to take 5 minutes to brainstorm what the first prototype of Guitar Buddy would look like:
                                </p>
                                <img class="card-img-top" src="final_project/brainstorming.png" alt="..." />
                                <br></br>
                                <h2 class="fw-bolder">Storyline</h2>
                                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">After having a general understanding of what Guitar Buddy's first prototype will be, we decided to create a
                                    storyline of what it would be like for an average beginner guitar player to use it. This is when Sam, my groups final team member, decided to design (by using Fusion360) and
                                    print out our first prototype (you will get more insights as to how this was established later on!). When establishing our storyline, we realized that Guitar Buddy 
                                    may be a solution for many different types of people. With that being said, our group decided to showcase the challenges a beginner guitar player may face for our first storyline.
                                    After we determined that this is the type of consumer that we would like to showcase first, it was time to create a humorous, yet practical storyline alongside my group members, 
                                    Aidan and Ava: 
                                    <br></br>
                                    <img class="card-img-top" src="final_project/story_first.png" alt="..." />
                                    <br></br>
                                    <img class="card-img-top" src="final_project/story_second.png" alt="..." />
                                    <h3 class="fw-bolder">Feedback Capture Grid #1</h3>
                                    <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">After presenting our storyboard and the concept of Guitar Buddy to our peers and professors, my group and I were able to execute our first
                                        feedback capture grid:
                                        <br></br>
                                        <img class="card-img-top" src="final_project/feedback_capture.png" alt="..." />
                                        <br></br>
                                        <h3 class="fw-bolder">Feedback Capture Grid #2</h3>
                                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">The next step to this process to ensure that Guitar Buddy would be a success, we asked our peers to try out and give us feedback to our
                                            first prototype. This is essential to our process when creating our second prototype. Thus, we decided to create a second feedback capture grid to make sure the information our
                                            peers gave us was organized:
                                            <br></br>
                                        <img class="card-img-top" src="final_project/feedback_prototype_1.png" alt="..." />
                                        </p> 
                                        <br></br>
                                        <h3 class="fw-bolder">Feedback Capture Grid #3</h3>
                                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">Finally, after meeting with our peers and hearing what they had to say about our first prototype, we decided to create our second protoype. 
                                            After discussing the feedback from our first two capture grids, we decided to create our second prototype of Guitar Buddy. From here, we did the exact process for collecting feedback:
                                            asking potential consumers to test the prototype and to give us feedback. With this information, we established our third feedback capture grid:
                                            <br></br>
                                            <img class="card-img-top" src="final_project/feedback_prototype_2.png" alt="..." /> 
                                        </p>
                                        <h3 class="fw-bolder">Design Review</h3>
                                        <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-5">After executing 3 feedback capture grids, asking our peers and prospective consumers to test out the first two prototypes of Guitar Buddy, and finally reconnecting
                                            with those we have already interviewed, the Guitar Buddy team decided to establish a "Design Review" paper that would help us organize our thoughts
                                            and aspirations for the final prototype. Thus, we conducted a 2 page paper that will help us outline what we need to do in order to ensure success and eventually, present Guitar Buddy to our professors and peers:
                                            <br></br>
